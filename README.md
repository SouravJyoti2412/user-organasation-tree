Here’s an organized `README.md` file to guide you on setting up and starting both the Django backend and React frontend projects. This file assumes the following project structure:

### `README.md`

# Full-Stack Organization Tree Project

This project includes a Django backend and a React frontend. The backend provides API endpoints, and the frontend displays and interacts with organizational data using a dynamic tree structure.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python** (v3.8 or higher)
2. **Node.js** (v12 or higher) and **npm**
3. **Virtual Environment** (recommended for Python projects)

## Project Structure

- `backend_project/app`: Contains the Django application with all backend functionality.
- `frontend_project/org-tree-ui`: Contains the React project for the frontend UI.

---

## Backend Setup (Django)

### 1. Navigate to the Backend Directory


cd backend_project


### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.


python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'


### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:


pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Apply Migrations

Navigate to the Django app directory and apply migrations to set up the database:


python manage.py migrate


### 5. Run the Development Server

Once migrations are complete, you can start the Django development server:


python manage.py runserver


By default, the server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 6. Setting Up CORS (if necessary)


## Frontend Setup (React)

### 1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

Open a new terminal and navigate to the React project directory:


cd frontend_project/org-tree-ui


### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages for the React app:


npm install


### 3. Start the React Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:


npm start


The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

---

## Running the Full Project

1. **Start the Django backend**:
   - Open a terminal, activate the virtual environment, and run `python manage.py runserver` from the `backend_project` directory.

2. **Start the React frontend**:
   - Open a separate terminal, navigate to `frontend_project/org-tree-ui`, and run `npm start`.

With both servers running, the React frontend will communicate with the Django backend via the API endpoints.

---

## Additional Notes

### API Endpoints

Ensure that the React app points to the correct Django API endpoints. Modify the API URLs in your frontend code if necessary (e.g., set the base URL as `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

### Environment Variables

For better project management, consider using environment variables to store configuration settings such as API endpoints.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Virtual Environment Activation**: Ensure you activate the virtual environment in the backend before installing dependencies.
- **CORS Errors**: If you encounter CORS issues, check that the frontend URL is allowed in Django’s CORS settings.
- **Port Conflicts**: Make sure no other applications are running on ports `8000` (Django) or `3000` (React).

This README file provides an organized setup guide for both backend and frontend projects. Ensure you have all dependencies installed and each project is configured to interact correctly. Happy coding!
